- The goal of a book recommendation system is to provide users with recommendations that are tailored based on user feedback.
- you enter a book name , based on existing user database we will look for users who have read that book.
    - we will analyse the reading activity for those users , and recommend the books read by these readers
    - we are assuming if two users like the same thing they are likely to have other similar interests as well.
    - this method is call **Collaborative Filtering**.
